## Social detriments demystified

## The problem it solves
MISSING DEFINITIONS AND DATA IN RELATION TO OVERALL HEALTH
Although it sounds obvious that health is more than clinical factors, there is no quantified , relatable , timely accessible and actionable data â€“ both at individual and aggregate levels.

## Challenges we ran into
- Since this is a new concept for Indian Health industry there were limited resources at our disposal.
- Documentation challenges.
- Usual bugs and syntactical challenges while building the codebase.
